# My emacs configuration

# Proudly Found Elsewhere [at Radamant's page](https://github.com/radamant/.emacs.d)

This configuration uses the
[pallet](https://github.com/rdallasgray/pallet) package manager for
managing your emacs packages.

It also includes self bootstrapping when pallet does not yet exist.

## How to use this configuration

1. fork this to your own account
1. clone it to your ~/.emacs.d/
1. make a shell script that loads your emacs (like in http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18330954/using-cask-with-emacs-app)
1. Install cask: http://cask.github.io/installation/
1. Open a terminal, go to ~/.emacs.d/ and run `cask install`
1. open emacs
